# ZCEggify
Based off of MobCapture.
See MobCapture on SpigotMC to see additional information.

With ZCEggify you are able to capture mobs by hitting them with an item, or by throwing a projectile at them.

After your projectile hits your target, if you have the proper permissions the mob will turn into a special spawn egg. This spawn egg saves all forms of data concerning this mob (All that I could think to add).

Payment for capturing a mob can be either in the form of items or money. See the config on how to change between the two.
